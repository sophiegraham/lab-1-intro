# Assignment Overview: Lab 1

- Your assignment will be to create an "About Me" HTML and JS project.

## Instructions

1. Use Html (and what CSS you know), to allow people to quickly learn a few things about you, 
such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals.
1. Give the visitors to your About Me page the option to play at least guessing games that shows how fun-loving and interesting you are, and maybe include things about yourself that would not ordinarily appear in a portfolio page. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not. It's up to you! It's your project! (HINT: no one will check if this is real or not)
    * Use a button to "start" each guessing game.
    * Use `prompt`, `confirm` and/or `alert` to ask them game questions.
    * When the game is complete, modify the page to show success or failure of the game
    * Should work for them click the button to play again
1. Games
    1. Yes/No game
        1. Ask a series of five yes/no questions about you.
        2. Allow: y, yes, Y and YES (hint: use `toUpperCase` or `toLowerCase`) and same for no
        3. When done with questions, report how they did (either 4/5 or 80%) back to the page
    1. Guess an answer game
        1. Prompt them with question
        2. If they got it wrong, tell them so, how many guesses left, and maybe a hint. You can use alert, or add to re-prompt
        3. If they got it right, alert them and then modify the page to show the completed successfully
        4. If they exhausted all guesses, modify page to show they did not complete
    1. Stretch Goals:
        1. Moar games!
1. HINT: You may need to be careful with JavaScript's casual handling of string to numbers. Validate (check/test) your assumptions.
       
### Technical Requirements for "About Me"

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must be cleanly written with correct indentation and syntax. Look at examples online and in your textbook. 
- Note that your JS must pass the rules in the linter that we installed. You need to have the linter running while developing your solution.
- Your JS file contains a 'use strict' declaration at the top.
- Guessing game ideas: about you that involves **FIVE** yes/no questions. 
- Useful and descriptive `console.log()` messages in the JS are well written and correctly displaying to the browser console.
- Use CSS to style your page as you see fit, to the level of abilities in CSS that you currently have
- Add, Commit, Push process is being followed; it is evident in GitHub that commits are made regularly, and with good commit messages that explain the WHY of the commit.
